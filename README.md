# _Read _Write _App

> 0.1.0

Another note-taking application ("_Keep Like_"), based on the **Vue** framework and the State Management library [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org)

Dealing with the Fine-Grained Reactivity of **SolidJS**: `useSignal` / `useComputed`

## Features

Each note is "versioned", so it's possible to return to the previous version and/or the next one, as long as there is no new version...

When editing an earlier note, later notes are deleted; or when adding a new version (manually).
